I come in peace. I didn't bring artillery. But I'm pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I'll kill you all.
â€”General James Mattis, United States Marine Corps

PROPOSAL
Counterinsurgency is a game where the player is the leader of a group of soldiers, whose mission is to stabilize a small village in a war-torn country. The player leads their soldiers on civil-military operations; working with the locals to establish positive relationships while simultaneously diminishing the influence of destabilizing elements, through both combat and non-combat operations. This requires the player to understand of the cultural and political conditions in this village, the personalities and skills of their own soldiers, and most importantly, the long-term repercussions of their actions.

You will learn about the soldiers whom you are responsible for; their personalities, their eccentricities, and their lives. Some are eager to help the struggling local community, and some are eager to get out there and fight bad guys.

From the day you are boots-on-ground, your course is yours to determine. Will you decide to devote your efforts to crushing the insurgency? Will you work to gain the respect and honor of the local nationals? Your decisions can win you praise and promotions from your higher command, or scorn and derision from the locals. And at the end of the deployment, what really matters is whether you bring all your men home alive...
