*"I come in peace. I didn't bring artillery. But I'm pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I'll kill you all."*

â€”General James Mattis, United States Marine Corps

COUNTERINSURGENCY

You are a military team leader, with the mission to stabilize a small village in a war-torn country. You will lead your soldiers on civil-military operations; working to establish good relationships with the local populace, and to halt the threat of violence by insurgent forces in the area, through both combat and non-combat operations. This requires the player to understand the cultural and political conditions in this village, the personalities and skills of their own soldiers, and most importantly, the long-term repercussions of their actions.

You will learn about the soldiers whom you are responsible for; their personalities, their eccentricities, and their lives. Each is motivated differently - some are eager to help the struggling local community, some are eager to get out there and fight bad guys, but most of them just want to get back in one piece.

From the day you are boots-on-ground, the decisions are yours to make, and you are responsible for what you do or fail to do. Will you devote your efforts to crushing the insurgency? Will you work to gain the respect and honor of the local nationals? Your decisions can win you praise and promotions from your higher command, scorn and derision from the locals, the loyalty and dedication of your soldiers, and everything in between.

All of these decisions culminate in one final question; after nine months, did you bring all your soldiers home?
