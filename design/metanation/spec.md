blurb: *Metanation games are connected to other players in the larger nation of Khotiana. New events, encounters, and situations are offered to you in this game mode. Select your team, and once boots hit the ground, expect the unexpected.*

Every deployment you complete changes the conditions in the METANATION, a.k.a. the greater nation of Khotiana. The conditions of the metanation from month to month, region to region, change based on the completed playthroughs of users. 

Access to the Metanation unlocks once you have completed one playthrough. This playthrough allows you the option of uploading your game to the Metanation.

METANATION GAME DIFFERENCES
* Metanation games do not require an internet connection if already in progress, but cannot be started or finished without one.
* Only games which have been uploaded affect events in the Metanation. However, events in the Metanation will affect an ongoing game.
* Games taking place in the Metanation have a higher difficulty level, and will share the world condition from a previous player's playthrough. A player will never be assigned a game based off of one of their own previous playthroughs. 
* Metanation games allow you to use your previous team, unlocking new content that can only be taken on by a team with a high skill level.
* Metanation games give you Metanation events.
* Metanation games allow you to select your team from characters that you have already completed a game with. 
  * This will spawn Multiple-Tour events for individual soldiers.

METANATION EVENTS

Depending on the month, a group of events will be unlocked based on the condition of the Metanation as a whole. These events affect every player in the region, and occasionally, every player in the game. 

PRESTIGE

Your selected unit gains Prestige for every Metanation game you complete victoriously. Prestige unlocks new content and furthers the plot of Metanation. More complex, static Leave events will take place as well.
