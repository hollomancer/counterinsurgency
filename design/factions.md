REPUTATION

VITALS and skills have an effect on the gain and loss of reputation. Reputation is based on faction category, so foreign and local reputation do not share with each other. When a character changes their faction, they lose a percentage of their reputation. 

INFLUENCE

The reputation of a character, combined with their relation with the faction itself, determines their influence with that faction. A faction's strength is determined by the sum total of influence all its characters have. Characters with the highest influence become leaders in the faction and determine its means.

ENDS AND MEANS

- A character's chosen faction is assigned at the beginning of the game and is subject to change based on events in the world.
- A character can only be part of one faction at a time.
- A character can only change their faction after their own faction initiates an event.
- A character will only change their faction if they have a negative opinion of it.
- A character will change their faction to whatever they have the highest relation with.
- When a faction initiates a particular event, relation modifiers are immediately checked for every character inside that faction. If the character doesn't like what that faction is doing, they could leave.
