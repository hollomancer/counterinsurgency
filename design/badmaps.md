BAD MAPS

The AOR, or area of responsibility, is already mapped overhead, but there is a lot of information missing that your intelligence section will need you conduct missions in order to complete. Depending on how the previous unit did,

[pEvent.pMission.number]
MISSION: Local atmospheric reconnaissance.
CONOP:
ORIGINATING: [pActor.name.protag.pS2] [pActor.name.protag.pUnit] INTELLIGENCE SECTION
LOCAL COMMAND AUTHORITY: [pActor.name.protag.pBncdr]
