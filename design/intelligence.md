Intelligence

Mechanical Spec
---
Intelligence points are a game abstraction indicating knowledge received about a faction, that only comes into play in the context of intelligence analysis.

 - ID the faction. This step can be skipped for the base factions initially.
 - Complete missions to gain additional Intelligence Points on involved factions. Intelligence Points accumulate, allowing you to gain additional information on a faction, and to unlock new missions.
 - Complete newly unlocked missions to make additional factions available at the Intel Fusion Cell.
