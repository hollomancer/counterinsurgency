TWO SECTION - INTELLIGENCE

Your battalion staff includes a 'Two Section,' focused on intelligence. They are responsible for getting information about your AOR (area of responsibility), and providing insights on what might be happening.

When you first encounter the Two Section, they are working with a lot of information that missing or out of date. Two Section will ask you to conduct missions, in order to complete it.

RELATIONSHIPS
* As your relationship with the Two Section develops, they will have more and more complex requests for you. They will also be able to provide much deeper information on other missions you may receieve.
* The Two Section tends to like you developing positive relationships with local nationals, but not to the point of favoritism (where you are favoring any one party over another).
