Mechanic Design

The day of remembrance is one day out of the deployment where no positive or negative vignettes will occur. Going out on patrol will result in nobody being around. Any W-ETHOS actions will result in nothing happening. Choosing not to patrol that day will result in a minor increase in reputation with all LN factions.

There will be a short vignette during the second shift of this day where the team will reflect on their actions up to this point.

STATUS EFFECT(associated)

You respected the Day of Remembrance, and the local population recognizes and respects this. +5 reputation to all LN factions.
