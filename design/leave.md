"Leave" is an event that takes place once per game.

This is the only static narrative of the game, and features a silent, invisible protagonist. It contains nonlinear, branching elements based on your individual performance in the metanation.

The first instance of "leave" is intended to be a drastic departure from the normal game flow, taking place in more of a visual novel format. Leave is intended to show the decisions you've made have affected your character's mental state.

When entering the metanation, leave events start to take on a much more emotionally bold significance.
