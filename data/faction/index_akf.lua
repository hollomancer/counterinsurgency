BASIS insurgents are difficult to gain intelligence on. To open them up for direct attack, you must;

	* Successfully reduce the power of one of the three main Insurgent factions enough that a BASIS leader can be targeted by intelligence. Capturing the BASIS HVT will open up the BASIS faction for targeting.
	* Capture a BASIS agent during one of their attacks - they are resistant to interrogation and impervious to negotation skill.

BASIS does not strike often, but they do strike spectacularly when they do. Expect at least one or two extremely deadly attacks by BASIS.

Any power that a character has with an individual AKF faction, also goes to BASIS.

Victories against BASIS have a significant effect on your score.
