The day of remembrance is one day out of the deployment where no positive or negative vignettes will occur. Going out on patrol will result in nobody being around. Any W-ETHOS actions will result in nothing happening. Choosing not to patrol that day will result in a minor increase in reputation with all LN factions.

There will be a short vignette during the second shift of this day where the team will reflect on their actions up to this point.

STATUS EFFECT(associated)
