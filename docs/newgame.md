New games are for players who want a clean slate to start with. The team you get is randomized, and the world you enter is unaffected by any other players.

COIN, much like combat itself, is random, capricious, and uncompromising. No player will enter their deployment dealing with the same situations and circumstances.

Every new game puts you in a randomly generated unit. The units adjacent to you and their attitudes, the strength and disposition of anti-Khotian forces, the political climate you enter, are all variable.

At the end of a Slicksleeve game, you have the option of uploading your game to the Metanation, and the Metanation game type is available. In Metanation games, you have the opportunity to resume with some of your previous characters.
