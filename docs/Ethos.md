SYSTEM: ETHOS

Ethos is a metric of how your team conducts itself.

The more Warrior Ethos you have, the more combat situations you will end up in - and the better prepared you will be for them. The more Diplomat Ethos you have, the more political intrigue you will end up in, and the better dialog options will be available.

However, the greater the disparity between your Warrior and Humanitarian ethos, the more likely it is that you will critically fail a Warrior or Humanitarian event. Being 'out of balance' has a negative effect on your global failure and critical failure modifiers, which are called on nearly every event that takes place in the game. For example, the one combat event you have with high Humanitarian Ethos may result in you losing soldiers and a Bad Ending, since you haven't kept the balance and built your Warrior Ethos. By the same token, a high Warrior Ethos could result in critically botching a Humanitarian Event.
