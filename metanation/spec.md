blurb: *Metanation games are connected to other players in the larger nation of Khotiana. New events, encounters, and situations are offered to you in this game mode. Select your team, and once boots hit ground, expect the unexpected.*

Every deployment you complete changes the conditions in the METANATION, a.k.a. the greater nation of Khotiana. The conditions of the metanation from month to month, region to region, change based on the completed playthroughs of users. 

Access to the Metanation unlocks once you have completed one playthrough. This playthrough allows you the option of uploading your game to the Metanation.

METANATION GAME DIFFERENCES
* Games taking place in the Metanation have a higher difficulty level, and will share the world condition from the previous player's playthrough. A player will never be assigned a game based off of one of their own previous playthroughs. 
* Metanation games allow you to use your previous team, unlocking new content that can only be taken on by a  team with a high skill level.
* Metanation games give you Metanation events.
* Metanation games allow you to select your team from characters that you have already completed a game with. 

METANATION EVENTS
Depending on the month, a group of events will be unlocked based on the condition of the Metanation as a whole. 

PRESTIGE
Your selected unit gains Prestige for every Metanation game you complete victoriously. Prestige can be redeemed for ingame and non-ingame rewards.
